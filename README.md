# Lynden IT Support
A simple support website designed to serve the students of Lynden High School.

## Purpose
This site was developed to demonstrate how the IT department could leverage a simple website to help mitigate the trivial support tickets caused by students and teachers who do not know how to use the technology they were given. This isn't the fault of the student or teacher, of course, why would you know something you were never taught? This project aimed to provide a simple and easy way to learn and troubleshoot the tech that the Lynden School District provided.
